# Industrial Automation using Function Block Programming  

## Project Overview

Function Block Programming is used for designing control logic in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) for industrial automation tasks. This project focuses on two key automation scenarios:
- Material handling conveyor automation.
- Tank fill and drain process automation.

Both projects leverage Control IO for logic implementation and Factory IO for dynamic simulation, allowing validation before deployment in an actual factory environment.


## Tech stack

- **Control IO** for control logic development.
- **Factory IO** for logic simulation.

## How to run
- Download the latest version of **Factory IO** https://factoryio.com/
- Open the *box_sorter_scene.factoryio* or *tank_scene.factoryio* in **Factory IO**.
- Run *box_sorter_controller.controlio* for *box_sorter_scene.factoryio* and *tank_controller.controlio* for *tank_scene.factoryio* to view the simualtions.
